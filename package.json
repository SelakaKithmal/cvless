  "description": "Cvless is a theme for static websites built with Jekyll. It aims for simplicity and readability by following best practices of graphic design, such as the use of [high contrast](https://www.contrastrebellion.com), [law of proximity](https://lawsofux.com/law-of-proximity), and of course, responsive layout. Its typography is based on the [Piazzolla type system](https://piazzolla.huertatipografica.com/), which performs extremely well over a wide range of font sizes.",
